            <h2> <p>
              This is Priyadharshini G, an engineering student from <b> Panimalar Institute of Technology.</b> Birth place being Tirunelveli, I was brought up in Tuticorin until 2009. My early schooling began from Holy Cross Anglo Indian Higher Secondary School. Ever since my dad's transfer, we moved to Chennai and I continued my schooling in <b> Anna Adarsh Matriculation Higher Secondary School. </b> I fairly had good grades in higher classes, 87.4% in 12th grade and 97.4% in 10th grade.Â  I believe engineering is rising, since I had no interest in medicine. Hence, I'm in the middle of my college life, building my engineering skills along with my passion in Public Speaking, in Toastmasters International. I'm also the secretary of PIT Toastmasters Club !
